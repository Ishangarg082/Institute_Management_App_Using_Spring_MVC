Institute Management System (IMS) Description

Institute Management System (IMS) is a comprehensive practice project developed by Ishan Garg, a B.Tech in Information Technology student at NSUT. It is developed to manage all the administrative processes of the educational institution. The application has three main user roles:

1. Admin: The admin exercises full authority over the institution's staff management. Admin receives a feature to add, update, and delete a record of staff. Thus, this role ensures the easy running of administrative functions of the institution.

2. Student: Students can see their data, that is, marks and the attendance record, through safe, password-protected interfaces. This feature empowers students to monitor their performances easily.

3. Staff: Staff has read and write permission about the details of the students, so can update attendance as well as marks according to the requirement. Also with the option to add, update, or or remove courses. This is password protected; hence proper handling of the sensitive information would be ensured.

It needs data to work smoothly so please add the appropriate data in the database first. Also, proper changes were required in the configuration file.

Improvements in the near future include bulk attendance and mark uploads using file I/O to further the application's functionality and user interface.
Will be optimizing app soon probably after endsems

The system is open for its users to give comments about improvements.
